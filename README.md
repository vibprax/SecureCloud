## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of information technology, secure data migration between cloud platforms has become a critical challenge. This project delves into the intricacies of migrating structured and unstructured hospital data from AWS to GCP while maintaining data integrity, confidentiality, and regulatory compliance.

## Infrastructure Design

This section outlines the selection of AWS and GCP as cloud platforms for the project. It highlights the architecture, cloud service selection, and network setup.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the secure data migration, several prerequisites need to be established. These include data preparation, encryption scripting, secure communication channels, and compliance adherence.

## Working

The working of the project encompasses data processing on an AWS EC2 instance, encryption scripting, data upload to AWS S3, and secure FTP setup for data transfer.

## Implementation

This section provides an in-depth overview of the project's execution. It covers the deployment of cryptography libraries, integration of PyPDF2 and mysql-connector-python, setup of vsftpd for secure FTP, and role-based access controls.

## Output

The output of the project demonstrates the successful migration of structured and unstructured data to GCP. It verifies patient data synchronization and adherence to regulatory standards.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project showcases the successful implementation of secure data migration practices, emphasizing encryption, secure communication, and compliance. It contributes to the evolving landscape of cloud-based data security.
